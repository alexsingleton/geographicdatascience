As part of a major investment in the acquisition, management and analysis of Big Data, the Economic and Social Research Council is investing c Â£6 million over five years in the Retail Business Datasafe (RBDS), based at University College London (UCL) and in partnership with the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford. In addition to a freestanding programme of research into the retail sector, the RBDS will also work in partnership with the University of Leeds to create the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC), which will create, supply, maintain and deliver consumer-related Big Data to a range of end users, and will also conduct outreach activities. 

Applicants are invited to provide data science / programming support at the University of Liverpool node of the RBDS; which is managed by Dr Alex Singleton.

This role will provide programming support to the programme of service delivery and research. The vast majority of application development will be online, so we would be especially interested in hearing from individuals with web development experience. Furthermore, we will be developing a number of web mapping applications, and experience of developing interfaces to spatial data within online environments would be highly desirable.

You will be joining a large team of PhD and other researchers at the University of Liverpool and will be expected to interact with the other researchers within the RBDS/CDRC at UCL and the University of Oxford.The post is available until 13 February 2019.

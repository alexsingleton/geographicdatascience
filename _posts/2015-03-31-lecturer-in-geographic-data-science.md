Integral to a programme of external and institutional investment in Geographic Information Science (GISc) and the Centre for Spatial Demographics Research, we wish to recruit the first of three Lecturers in Geographic Data Science. You will deliver high quality research, and contribute to undergraduate and postgraduate teaching in Human Geography within the Department of Geography and Planning.

We are looking for individuals with excellent research profiles in GISc, Applied Geocomputation and Spatial Data Analysis, and are particularly interested in those with experience of working with big data and developing open source software tools. You will become part of the Population and Spatial Analysis Research Group and should aim to build strong collaborative links with our existing team, and the wider staff in the School and University. There will be opportunities to develop your research interests and work in interdisciplinary/cross-disciplinary ways with other staff within the University. The post is available from 1 June 2015.

Forward any questions to Professor Alex Singleton ([alex.singleton@liverpool.ac.uk](mailto:alex.singleton@liverpool.ac.uk)) or Professor Andy Plater (Head of Department) ([Gg07@liverpool.ac.uk)](mailto:Gg07@liverpool.ac.uk)

**Closing Date: 24 April 2015:** **[Apply Here](https://www.liv.ac.uk/working/jobvacancies/currentvacancies/academic/a-587740/)**

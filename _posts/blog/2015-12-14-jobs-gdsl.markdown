We have spent much of the past 12 months working on our [e-resilience project](http://geographicdatascience.com/project/eresilience/) which has now been featured in the ESRC 2016 edition of the ["Britain In"](http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-events-and-publications/publications/magazines-and-newsletters/britain-in-magazine/) magazine.

A copy of the article is available [here](/assets/pdf/BRIT16_Retail.pdf).

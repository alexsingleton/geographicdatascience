For the past year we have been working on a number of projects related to Internet use  and retail. These have culminated in a measure of e-resilience which assesses the extent to which retail centres have spatially differentiated vulnerability to the impact of online consumption. This work recently featured in the  [Britain in 2016 magazine](http://geographicdatascience.com/blog/press/britain-2016/), and also our recent paper in [Geoforum](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.11.013).

Integral to this work has been development of the [Internet User Classification](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/product/cdrc-2014-iuc-geodata-pack) which is a geodemographic of use and engagement with the Internet. While creating this indicator we partnered with [Mark Graham](http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/graham/) and [Grant Blank](http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/?id=177) at the [Oxford Internet Institute ](http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) to develop a small area estimate from their [Oxford Internet Survey](http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/). While doing this we thought it might be a good idea to create some map books which you can download below or on the [CDRC website](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/product/cdrc-internet-user-mapbook).

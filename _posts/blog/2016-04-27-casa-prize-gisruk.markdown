Many thanks to [CASA-UCL](http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa) for offering me [the Prize for the Best Paper on Spatial Analysis](http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa/news/2016-04-06--Sinesio-Alves-Junior-Award-2016) for my research on [Using Geographically Weighted Regression to Explore Spatial Variation in Survey Behaviour](https://blogs.city.ac.uk/addresponse/files/2014/09/LahtinenBrunsdonButt_FINAL-16qzy9t.pdf) co-authored with Chris Brunsdon (National University of Ireland, Maynooth) and Sarah Butt (City University London), presented at the annual GISRUK Conference held at the University of Greenwich, 30th March - 1st April 2016.

This research is part of a wider research project, [ADDResponse](https://blogs.city.ac.uk/addresponse/), funded by the ESRC and looking at the opportunities for using auxiliary data when predicting survey nonresponse in social surveys. This paper is at the forefront of research looking at the spatial differences in nonresponse modelling; and in particular, the possibility of spatial variation in response behaviour using regional interactions and geographically weighted regression. Results suggests there is geographical variation in response behaviour and that applying a “one size fits all” model to response behaviour may be insufficient.

The aim of this research is to gain a wider understanding of the possible biases and data quality issues in survey data. This would benefit the data users and those involved in the collection data alike.

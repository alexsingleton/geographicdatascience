A recent publication of IMD 2015 indices was used to examine the most deprived and the least deprived retail catchments in England. The catchments were estimated for more than 1300 UK retail centres, taking into account spatial interactions between potential customers, shopping destination attractiveness and distance between the two (see Dolega et al., 2016). The estimation of catchment area deprivation  was consistent with the ONS method, which measured the proportion of LSOAs that are in the most deprived decile nationally within each retail catchment. Thirteen of the most deprived catchments are entirely made of the neighbourhoods that are within the most deprived decile. Typically, these are small local centres located within large urban areas of the North, Midlands and Greater London.


Tables 1 and 2 show the 20 most deprived and 20 least deprived catchments respectively.

The successful candidates will deliver internationally excellent research in one or both of the following two departmental research areas:

* [Spatial Planning and Impact Assessment](http://www.liv.ac.uk/geography-and-planning/research/spatial-planning-impact-assessment/about/)

* [Modelling, Population and Geo-computation](http://www.liv.ac.uk/geography-and-planning/research/modelling-population-and-geocomputation/about/) - on this latter area, you might also like to see the GDSL [projects](/projects/) page.

You will make a major contribution to the teaching of both Undergraduate and Postgraduate programmes in the field of Planning. The Undergraduate [MPlan](http://www.liv.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/town-and-regional-planning-mplan/overview/) programme and the Postgraduate [Master of Civic Design (MCD)](http://www.liv.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/town-and-regional-planning-mcd/overview/) are both accredited by the [Royal Town Planning Institute](http://www.rtpi.org.uk/). You should have a degree in a spatial planning related discipline (e.g. planning, geography, transport etc) and preference will be given to individuals with a Postgraduate qualification in a relevant subject.

## The Size

A widely accepted measure of the extent of UK town centres at national level is that used by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG).  Although town centres constantly evolve, the 1300 DCLG 2004 boundaries provide a systematic estimate of a retail area extent. Such boundaries also allow a  comparison of retail area dynamics and change to their structure on a like-for-like basis.  The size of a retail centre, measured either by floorspace or a number of outlets is  often used to estimate town centre attractiveness or the position within retail hierarchy. The map below, using proportional symbols, shows all town centres in England and Wales, sized based on survey data from [Local Data Company](http://www.localdatacompany.com/). It is clear that although the majority of retail centres are relatively small (below 200 outlets) dozen of larger centres (500-2000 outlets) dominate the retail landscape of each sub-region/region. However the domination of Central London over the South East, with over 10000 retail and 14000 leisure and services outlets, is staggering.

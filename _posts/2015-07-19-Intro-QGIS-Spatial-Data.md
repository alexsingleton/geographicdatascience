A workshop on **Introduction to QGIS: Understanding and Presenting Spatial Data** is being run by the Geographic Data Science Lab and the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) at the University of Liverpool.

**Date:** Thursday 1st October 2015, 9:30am – 4pm

**Venue:** Training Room 1, Sydney Jones Library, University of Liverpool

**Instructor:** Dr Nick Bearman

**Cost:** £45 student, £80 HE / public sector, £200 commercial (see below for details)

This course will introduce spatial data and show you how to import and display spatial data within the open source GIS program QGIS. We will also cover creating choropleth maps, some basic spatial data analysis (e.g. calculating rates) and appropriate methods of visualising spatial data. By the end of the course you will be able to load data into QGIS, symbolise it effectively and be able to prepare a publication quality map.

No previous experience of GIS or QGIS is required, but some experience of using spatial data will be beneficial. Please email Nick for more information. Refreshments and lunch are provided, and numbers on the course are limited and allocated on a first come, first served basis.

If you are already familiar with the basic elements of GIS, you may wish to attend the course “Introduction to Using R for Spatial Analysis” instead where focus on applying these GIS skills in R, and develop your spatial analysis skills ([more details](http://geographicdatascience.com/training%20course/2015/07/19/R-Spatial-Analysis-Liverpool/)).

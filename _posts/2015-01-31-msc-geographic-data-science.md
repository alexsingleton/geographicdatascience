Within an applied setting, emphasis is placed on developing skills in the visualisation, modelling and statistical analysis of spatial data using both web-based and traditional techniques.

To support this, the degree seeks to help students develop a wide range of skills including critical analysis (oral, textual, visual and numeric), written and oral presentation, team working and the use of a range of information technologies and software tools.

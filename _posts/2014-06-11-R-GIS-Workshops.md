Two workshops on using R as a GIS are being run by the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool.

*Course 1:* Using R for Google Map Making, Tuesday 8th July 2014, 11am - 4pm

and

*Course 2:* Using R for Geodemographic Analysis, Thursday 10th July 2014, 11am - 4pm

*Venue:* Gilbert Computer Lab, Jane Herdman building, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GP

*Cost:* free

*Instructor:* Dr Nick Bearman

Course Description: Both courses provide an introduction to using R as a GIS and explore the benefits of using R over other GIS software. 

*Course 1: Using R for Google Map Making, Tuesday 8th July 2014, 11am - 4pm*

Introduces how R can be combined with Google Maps using the GGPlot library to create Google Maps base maps and plot, import and map spatial data.  It will also cover how to import and display different types of spatial data and the creation of choropleth maps. In addition, content will also look at using routing tools from the Google Maps API within R, and discuss issues to be aware of when handling sensitive data in the cloud. 

*Course 2: Using R for Geodemographic Analysis, Thursday 10th July 2014, 11am - 4pm*

Content will cover how R can be used with geodemographic classifications such as OAC (the ONS Output Area Classification). This will be illustrated through a number of real world exercises, including spatial and non-spatial use of data. A geodemographic map of Liverpool will be created and participants will be shown how to calculate index scores. Examples of the use of geodemographic classification will be covered, and OAC will be used to apply geodemographic classification to a real world exercise.

Both courses end with an Optional Mapping Clinic, where we can discuss with you on an individual basis your current mapping projects and challenges. 

No previous experience of GIS or R is required, but some experience of using spatial data will be beneficial. 

These courses are supported by the ESRC and are free to attend. Refreshments and lunch are provided, although numbers are limited and allocated on a first come, first served basis.

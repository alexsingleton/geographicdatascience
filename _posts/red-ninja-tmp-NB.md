On Monday a group of us attended a [Machine Learning and Data Science](http://www.meetup.com/Liverpool-Machine-Learning-and-AI/events/225747902/) meetup, hosted by [Red Ninja](http://www.redninja.co.uk/) in Liverpool. Munsoor Negyal and Matthew Doubleday from Shop Direct talked about how they used machine learning and data science in their data analytics work at Shop Direct. I had no background in machine learning, but did learn that it is a relatively new concept that is still being developing, both in terms of the technology used to implement it (Munsoor mentioned [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), as well as [Spark R](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html)) but also the concepts and terms around it (there seems to be no one standard definition). Matthew defined it as any algorithm that involves some type of feedback loop, so the algorithm can learn, which works well for me. 

Red Ninja have hosted three of these meet ups now and are planning more in the [future][(http://www.meetup.com/Liverpool-Machine-Learning-and-AI/). Their office is in the Elevator Studios and they are "a design-led technology company, grown in Liverpool and working across the world". As a part of the evening they ran a competition for the best Tweet, which I won with this tweet:

Here is the prize they gave me, now proudly on my desk:

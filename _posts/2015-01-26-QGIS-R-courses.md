On Thus 22nd and Fri 23rd Jan, I ran two workshops on GIS, **Introduction to QGIS: Understanding and Presenting Spatial Data** and **Introduction to Using R for Spatial Analysis**. Both workshops went very well, and I have posted the material I used on my blog at:

- [Introduction to QGIS: Understanding and Presenting Spatial Data](http://www.nickbearman.me.uk/2015/01/introduction-to-qgis-understanding-and-presenting-spatial-data/)
- [Introduction to Using R for Spatial Analysis](http://www.nickbearman.me.uk/2015/01/introduction-to-using-r-for-spatial-analysis/)

Please feel free to use and adapt the material, subject to the requirements of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en for details). 

If you are interested in attending either of these courses in the future, please send me a email (n.bearman@liverpool.ac.uk) and I will add you to a list to hear about future courses.

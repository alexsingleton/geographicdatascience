####Temporal Output Area Classification

A geodemographic classification provides a set of categorical summaries of the built and socio-economic characteristics of small geographic areas. Many such classifications, such as that developed in this paper, are created entirely from data extracted from a single decennial census of population. Such classifications are often criticised as becoming less useful over time because of the changing composition of small geographic areas. This project presents a methodology for exploring the veracity of this assertion, by examining changes in UK Census-based geodemographic indicators over time, as well as a substantive interpretation of the over-all results.

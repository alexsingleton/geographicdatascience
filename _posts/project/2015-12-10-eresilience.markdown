####e-Resilience of UK retail centres

The project assesses the extent to which retail centres have spatially differentiated vulnerability to the impacts of online consumption. The project is funded by ESRC and is conducted in partnership with the Local Data Company (LDC). It provides conceptual framework for 'e-resilience', presents a national geodemographic of Internet user behaviour and delivers an operational measure of e-resilience, which defines those retail centres in England that are the most or least e-resilient.

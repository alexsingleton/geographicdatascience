####Grid Population

This ESRC-funded project explores how the population of the UK is, or has been, geographically distributed. It is addressing questions such as: are health inequalities between places greater now than in the past? What makes localities different â€” are they geographically distinguished more by housing tenure or health than they are by employment status or ethnicity? What areas have the greatest diversity of people and how has this changed between 1971 and 2011? To answer these questions, we will generate population surfaces from publicly available Census data for 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 to enable direct comparisons between Censuses. The resource produced will be made freely-available and it is likely to be widely used by academic researchers, local and national government, amongst others.

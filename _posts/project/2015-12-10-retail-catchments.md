####A National-Scale Huff Retail Gravity Model for England
This study is concerned with the problem of estimating the extent and volume of potential customer patronage flows between retail centres, that is, forming an estimate of the catchment area of a retail centre.

The fundamental hypothesis is that the closer a retail centre and the more attractive it is, the more likely it will be patronised by customers from a given location. Based on the Huff retail gravity model we estimated the probabilities of a person living in a given LSOA patronising a retail centre in England.

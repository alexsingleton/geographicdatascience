A recent publication on 'E-resilience in UK town centres' has just been published in a report led by Neil Wrigley and Erin Brookes at the University of Southampton:

Wrigley, N and Brookes, E (eds) 2014. 'Evolving high streets: resilience and reinvention - perspectives from social science'. ESRC/ Univ of Southampton, ISBN. 9780854329809, 52 pp. [(download)](http://www.riben.org.uk/Cluster_publications_&_media/)

The rapid growth of online sales has impacted UK town centres in complex ways and can be viewed as a source of long term change to their structure. The issue is difficult to measure as it is multidimensional and varies spatially. The concept of e-resilience defines the vulnerability of British town centres to the impacts of online sales and attempts to measure them. Essentially the e-resilience is about the balance between both supply and demand factors. The demand factors relate to consumer behaviour impacting the decision whether or not to shop online. Such decision is likely to be determined by catchment demographics, Internet connectivity and local retail/service offer.

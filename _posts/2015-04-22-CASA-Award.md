Alekos Alexiou won the "Prize for the Best Paper on Spatial Analysis" for his research [The Role of Geographical Context in Building Geodemographic Classifications](https://speakerdeck.com/player/4cbeaa9241664567af64f756d1415b37#), presented in the Annual GISRUK Conference held at the University of Leeds, 15th - 17th April 2015.

Many thanks to [CASA-UCL](http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa) for offering this prize.

This is the first part of a wider research project regarding the geographic sensitivity of socio-spatial patterns, by examining the case studies of Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, along with some preliminary findings of a more generalised approach of socio-spatial pattern homogeneity. This was extended in a talk given at the [Association of American Geographers Annual Meeting in Chicago, April 2015](https://speakerdeck.com/player/772d0c231d2745069bcf3d196ff610c2?#), and examined the degree of homogeneity within neighbourhood typology created over a range of scales across England. 

The aim of this wider research is to produce geographic extents that maximise local socio-spatial variation. It is essentially a MAUP approach which could be used in various studies regarding population dynamics.

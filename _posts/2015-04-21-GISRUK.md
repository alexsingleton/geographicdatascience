## GISRUK2015, Leeds

The GISRUK conference was held in Leeds this year and attracted a strong attendance from our research team.  
There were three presentations given by Liverpool researchers:

###TravelOAC: development of travel geodemographic classifications for England and Wales based on open data by Nick Bearman. 
This project used 2011 Census and and custom routing data to generate a custom travel geodemographic looking at public and private transport access and use.

###National scale application of a Huff gravity model for the estimation of town centre retail catchment area by Michail Pavlis

###The Role of Geographical Context in Building Geodemographic Classifications
This is the first part of a wider research regarding the Geographic Sensitivity of socio-spatial patterns, by examining the case studies of Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, along with some preliminary findings of a more generalised approach of socio-spatial pattern homogeneity. The aim of this wider research is to produce geographic extents that maximize local socio-spatial variation - essentially a MAUP approach. 
Presented at the GIS Research UK Conference in Leeds, April 2015 and awarded by CASA-UCL as the best paper in Spatial Analysis.

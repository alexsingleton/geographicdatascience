## Regional Studies Association Winter Conference, London

The RSA Winter conference was held in London this year and attracted a strong attendance from our research team.  
There were three presentations given by Liverpool researchers:

###Comparing the internal socio economic structure of regions by Alekos Alexiou

###Geodemographics and digital cultures: Developing a national classification of Internet use and engagement by Dean Riddlesden.

###E-Resillience of British retail centres by Les Dolega.

The study examines the vulnerability of British retail centres to the impacts of increasing internet sales and attempts to provide a measure of these effects.  E-resilience is concerned with the balance between exposure of retail centres to consumers who are heavily engaged with information and communication technologies and the retail mix, that might enhance or constrain these effects.

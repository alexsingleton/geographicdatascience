A workshop on **Introduction to Using R for Spatial Analysis** is being run by the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool.

**Date:** Friday 23rd Jan 2015, 9:30am – 4pm

**Venue:** Training Room 1, Sydney Jones Library, University of Liverpool

**Instructor:** Dr Nick Bearman

**Cost:** £45 student, £85 HE / public sector, £200 commercial *(see below for details)*

This course will cover an introduction to R, how to load and manage spatial data and how to create maps using R. We will look at appropriate ways of using classifications for choropleth maps, using loops in R to create multiple maps and some basic spatial analysis. We will be using R Studio to work with the R environment. By the end of the course you will be able to load data into R, represent it effectively and be able to prepare an output quality map. 

Experience of creating maps in ArcGIS, QGIS or similar is required, but experience of using R is not required. Refreshments and lunch are provided, and numbers on the course are limited and allocated on a first come, first served basis.

If you are not familiar with the basic elements of GIS, you may wish to attend the course “Introduction to QGIS: Understanding and Presenting Spatial Data” before this course which covers basic GIS skills ([more details](http://geographicdatascience.com/training%20course/2014/12/01/Introduction-to-QGIS/)).

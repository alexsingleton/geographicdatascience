#About
This is the repository for the 

website that I use to blog about the various academic projects I am working on. I switched to Jekyll from wordpress and have used code or resources from a variety of different sources. I detail these on the following [blog post](http://www.alex-singleton.com/software/2014/01/03/Swappping-From-Wordpress-to-Jekyll/).

Please feel free to use my the code as the basis of your site if you think it would be useful.

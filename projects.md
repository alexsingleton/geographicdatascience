Members of the Geographic Data Science Lab conduct research at the intersection of Geographic Information Science, Spatial Analysis and Applied Geocomputation. We are interested in coupling burgeoning new and dynamic data sources with advanced quantitative and computational methodology to advance debates around problems of global socio-economic importance. Our substantive interests are diverse, and we aim for our outputs to be publically engaging, with many of our projects linked to external partners. The following are our current or recent research projects. Some selected outputs are listed where appropriate. <img class="img-openpaper" src="/public/images/iconmonstr-download-13-icon.svg"></img>= Open Access

### Retail Business Datasafe / Consumer Data Research Centre

<img src="/public/images/cdrc.png"></img>

As part of a major investment in the acquisition, management and analysis of Big Data, the Economic and Social Research Council is investing c Â£6 million over five years in the Retail Business Datasafe (RBDS), based at University College London (UCL) in partnership with the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford. In addition to a freestanding programme of research into the retail sector, the RBDS will also work in partnership with the University of Leeds to create the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC), which will create, supply, maintain and deliver consumer-related Big Data to a range of end users, and which will also provide a range of outreach activities.

<img src="/public/images/retailchange.png"></img>

This project examines geographic variation in business rates between retail centres of England and Wales, examining differences emerging within regions and also by composite retail function. The project is conducted in partnership with the Local Data Company (LDC) provides evidence that may be useful in reconfiguring future rates in order to serve issues of regional vitality and the economic health of town centres.

### The eResilience of British Retail Centres: Creating a national model of retail area resilience to online shopping.

<img src="/public/images/retail_esoc.jpg"></img>

This project explores patterns of retail e-Resilience in terms of the extent to which retail centres are exposed to consumers who are heavily engaged with information and communication technologies, and the virtual retail channels that these enable. This seek to ascertain how e-Resilience may be quantifiably measured and generalised, and to develop a methodological framework through which the constituent multiple dimensions can be collected and compiled into usable indicators for use by academic and retailer stakeholders.

### Leveraging the Google Cloud to Estimate Individual Level CO2 Emissions Linked to the School Commute.

<img class="img-icon" src="/public/images/iconmonstr-user-icon.svg"></img> [Alex Singleton](/people/#alexsingleton), [Nick Bearman](http://localhost:4000/people/#nickbearman)

<img src="/public/images/co2.png"></img>

This "big data" research has produced a national coverage and geographically sensitive individual scale model of CO2 emissions linked to the school commute. This is the first time such a geographically detailed and extensive model has been created, and is enabled in this instance through the application of an innovative geocomputational methodology for the analysis of around 7.5 million individual level pupil school commuting records.

### Visualisation of Broadband Equity

<img src="/public/images/bb.png"></img>

This project implements alternate methods of online geo-visualisation for the communication of broadband access and speed inequity to stakeholders in the use and development of this key national infrastructure. The government policy to place new services online first has created a social imperative to understanding the geography of these access inequalities; stimulating investments in this area such as the rural broadband development fund. This project maps multiple millions of postcode level speed test results at a local geographic scale, providing critical insight into the geography of broadband access and speed.

### Using Secondary Data to Measure, Monitor and Visualise Spatio-Temporal Uncertainties in Geodemographic Classification.

This research utilises secondary data sources to monitor and visualise the likely cumulative change in neighbourhood conditions as measured by the 2011 Census of Population. A range of open secondary data sources are used to facilitate the updating of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Output Area Classification during the immediate (2012-13) post Census period.

This research investigates the use of exploratory data mining and visualisation techniques on data generated from the RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations) dataset provided by the Health and Safety Executive, to identify spatial and temporal patterns on accidents at work.

### North American Geodemographics

<img src="/public/images/US.png"></img>

Open or free geodemographics have a lineage in the UK that is not mirrored in the US. As such this research project has utilised the American Community Survey to develop an open source geodemographic classification. The classification is firmly rooted in the social scientific literature and is organized around conceptual framework of Concepts, Domains, and Measures. This classification aims to add nuance to our vocabulary for American communities and overcomes some of the problems now associated with univariate analysis of census tract data. We hope that by making the classification and completely transparent and open source it can refined and adapted over time.

### Geographically Weighted Geodemographics
<img class="img-icon" src="/public/images/iconmonstr-user-icon.svg"></img> [Alexander Alexiou](/people/#alexanderalexiou), [Alex Singleton](/people/#alexsingleton)

This project aims to redefine those standard methods through which geodemographic classifications are created, by developing an extension to traditional methodology that incorporates spatial context and relationships between small area geography. This research proposal is heavily reliant on a variety of geocomputational, statistical and data mining techniques that could be considered outside the remit of standard quantitative practice in social science. The overarching theme of incorporating measures of spatial non-stationarity into geodemographic classification is itself methodological innovative and as a technique has not yet been developed nor implemented in a substantive context.

### Exploring the Geography of Geographers

Through interrogation of national coverage individual level schools and HE data this project examined the the flow of geographers into Higher Education from across the UK. The characteristics and domicile of students is profiled both geographically and by a series of widening participation metrics to examines whether Geography as a discipline can be considered to be widening participation or entrenching difference.

### Alternate National Crime Mapping Visualisations

<img class="img-icon" src="/public/images/iconmonstr-user-icon.svg"></img> [Alex Singleton](/people/#alexsingleton)  

<img src="/public/images/police.png"></img>

In 2011 the Home Office released the police.uk website which provided a high resolution map of recent crime data for the national extents of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Through this free service, crimes were represented as points plotted on top of a Google map, and visible down to a street level of resolution. However, in order to maintain confidentiality and to comply with data disclosure legislation, individual level crimes were aggregated into points that represented clusters of events that were located over a series of streets, thus creating a spurious level of precision. This research presented a new method of translating âpointâ crime events into a new representational form that is tied to street network geography; and presenting these results in an alternate national crime mapping portal [www.policestreets.co.uk](http://www.policestreets.co.uk).

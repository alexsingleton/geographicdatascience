            <h3>We conduct research at the intersection of GIS, Spatial Analysis and Applied Geocomputation. We are interested in coupling burgeoning new and dynamic data sources with advanced quantitative and computational methodology to advance debates around problems of global socio-economic importance. Our substantive interests are diverse, and we aim for our outputs to be publically engaging, with many of our projects linked to external partners.</h3>

There are on going opportunities to join GDSL.

##Masters
We have an exciting [MSc in Geographic Data Science](https://www.liv.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/geographic-data-science-msc/overview/) the full details of which can be found here on the programme page; however, we have also produced a flyer that can be downloaded here.

##PhD
We are interested in hearing from excellent candidates [1st, 2.1 (or equivalent) at undergraduate] from a variety of backgrounds including but not limited to GIS, geocomputation, quantitative geography social science (geography, planning, sociology etc), social statistics, computer science, physics or mathematics.

We have on-going funding opportunities that are tied both to our programmes of research, and also the ESRC North West DTC. For more information, please get in touch with Alex Singleton ([alex.singleton@liverpool.ac.uk](alex.singleton@liverpool.ac.uk)).

There are also opportunities for exceptional candidates wishing to self-fund PhD study.

Members of our lab have broad interests, but we are especially interested in hearing from candidates wishing to pursue research in substantive or methodological topics related to:

* "Big Data"
* City Structure and Dynamics
* Geodemographics and Social Area Analysis
* Retail and Business
* Social and Geographic Network Analysis
* Social Media
* Geographic Data Visualisation
* Transport
* Wearable Computing / mobile devices
* Energy
* Health, Education, Policing
* Population, Demography and Segregation

##Post Doctorate
We advertise for postdoctoral researcher roles reasonably frequently, and these are typically detailed on our [blog](http://www.geographicdatascience.org), or promoted through our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geodatascience) feed. However, we also welcome contact from externally funded researchers who may wish to visit GDSL for a duration of time.

##Undergraduate
Teaching from members of GDSL is embedded within the programmes of the Department of Geography and Planning. You can find out about these [here](http://www.liv.ac.uk/geography-and-planning/).

##Visiting Researchers
If you are interested in visiting GDSL for a research visit we have space available to accommodate you. [Please get in touch with us!](mailto:alex.singleton@liverpool.ac.uk)

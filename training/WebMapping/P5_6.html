<h1>Practical: a step-by-step guide to the R leaflet package</h1>
<div id="the-leaflet-package" class="section level2">
<h2>The leaflet package</h2>
<p>Remember from the lecture that all Leaflet applications require us to prepare Leaflet resources such as the stylesheets (CSS) and the JavaScript library (JS). In R, the [leaflet] package simplifies this step and provide us a user-friendly interface to work with Leaflet maps without even knowing JavaScript and HTML (eventhough it’s very cool to know).</p>
<p>Installing and loading this package (and its dependencies) is very easy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;leaflet&quot;)
library(leaflet)</code></pre>
<p>For example, the following JavaScript/HTML code fragement from the lecture (loading Leaflet resource and initialising a map):</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;!--STEP 1: loading leaflet css and js files from the CDN--&gt;
        &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v0.7.7/leaflet.css&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;script src=&quot;http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v0.7.7/leaflet.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- your map element --&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;mymap&quot; style=&quot;height:300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>
<p>can be converted into R as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mymap &lt;- leaflet(height = 300)</code></pre>
<p>Note that after running this line of code, nothing will show up as we still have not attached the tile layer (Step 2.a in the lecture). Let’s do it again with a tile layer attached:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(leaflet)
mymap &lt;- leaflet(height = 300)
mymap &lt;- addTiles(mymap)
mymap</code></pre>
<p><div id="htmlwidget-4845" style="width:672px;height:300px;" class="leaflet"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-4845">{"x":{"calls":[{"method":"addTiles","args":["http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",null,null,{"minZoom":0,"maxZoom":18,"maxNativeZoom":null,"tileSize":256,"subdomains":"abc","errorTileUrl":"","tms":false,"continuousWorld":false,"noWrap":false,"zoomOffset":0,"zoomReverse":false,"opacity":1,"zIndex":null,"unloadInvisibleTiles":null,"updateWhenIdle":null,"detectRetina":false,"reuseTiles":false,"attribution":"&copy; <a href=\"http://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a>"}]}]},"evals":[]}</script> Note that leaflet’s functions such as addTiles modify the structure of the map object (in this case <code>mymap</code>) and return a modified map object. This modified map can be re-assigned to a variable. In the above example, for simplicity and readability we re-assign it to the old variable. The last line is to show the map object.</p>
<p>Looking at <code>addTiles</code> function signature (below), the default tile layer are composed by OpenStreetMap tiles. This can be changed by adding new value for <code>urlTemplate</code> parameter.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>addTiles(map, urlTemplate = &quot;http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png&quot;,
    attribution = NULL, layerId = NULL, group = NULL, options = tileOptions())</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="basic-map-markers-and-popups" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic Map: Markers and Popups?</h2>
<p>In this section we will look at how to visual a map with a marker and a popup window at the map center.</p>
<p>After attaching the tile layer into a map object as in the previous section, we can set/change the map view by setting a centre and a zooming level with function <code>setView</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>mymap &lt;- setView(mymap,lng = -2.9655722, lat = 53.405936, zoom = 15)
mymap</code></pre>
<p><div id="htmlwidget-4762" style="width:672px;height:300px;" class="leaflet"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-4762">{"x":{"calls":[{"method":"addTiles","args":["http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",null,null,{"minZoom":0,"maxZoom":18,"maxNativeZoom":null,"tileSize":256,"subdomains":"abc","errorTileUrl":"","tms":false,"continuousWorld":false,"noWrap":false,"zoomOffset":0,"zoomReverse":false,"opacity":1,"zIndex":null,"unloadInvisibleTiles":null,"updateWhenIdle":null,"detectRetina":false,"reuseTiles":false,"attribution":"&copy; <a href=\"http://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a>"}]}],"setView":[[53.405936,-2.9655722],15,[]]},"evals":[]}</script></p>
<p>The next step is to create a basic marker with popup:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lat &lt;-  53.405936
lng &lt;- -2.9655722
mymap &lt;- addMarkers(mymap,lng,lat,popup = &quot;&lt;a href='http://www.liverpool.ac.uk'&gt;University of Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;&quot;)
mymap</code></pre>
<p><div id="htmlwidget-6367" style="width:672px;height:300px;" class="leaflet"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-6367">{"x":{"calls":[{"method":"addTiles","args":["http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",null,null,{"minZoom":0,"maxZoom":18,"maxNativeZoom":null,"tileSize":256,"subdomains":"abc","errorTileUrl":"","tms":false,"continuousWorld":false,"noWrap":false,"zoomOffset":0,"zoomReverse":false,"opacity":1,"zIndex":null,"unloadInvisibleTiles":null,"updateWhenIdle":null,"detectRetina":false,"reuseTiles":false,"attribution":"&copy; <a href=\"http://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a>"}]},{"method":"addMarkers","args":[53.405936,-2.9655722,null,null,null,{"clickable":true,"draggable":false,"keyboard":true,"title":"","alt":"","zIndexOffset":0,"opacity":1,"riseOnHover":false,"riseOffset":250},"<a href='http://www.liverpool.ac.uk'>University of Liverpool</a>",null,null]}],"setView":[[53.405936,-2.9655722],15,[]],"limits":{"lat":[53.405936,53.405936],"lng":[-2.9655722,-2.9655722]}},"evals":[]}</script></p>
<p>In the code fragment above, since we only create a simple popup for the marker, the <code>popup</code> parameter can be used for convenience (popups can also be attached to shape objects in a similar way).</p>

<div id="creating-leaflet-map-with-open-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating Leaflet map with open data</h2>
<p>So far we have tried to create a Leaflet map with a single marker and a single popup using our hard-coded geographical information (lat,lng). In this section we will create a Leaflet map using data from from an open data-source, the <a href="http://www.airbnb.com">airbnb</a> dataset, available at <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html"><a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html" class="uri">http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html</a></a>.</p>
<p>We will be creating a map of all <i>airbnb</i> listings, each of them has a marker.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to download the data for London (already cleaned and available as CSV files) from <a href="http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-kingdom/england/london/2015-09-02/visualisations/listings.csv">here</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>london_airbnb_listings &lt;- read.csv('http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-kingdom/england/london/2015-09-02/visualisations/listings.csv',sep = ',')</code></pre>
<p>A dataframe of 25361 rows and 16 columns has been created. Let’s justhave a quick look at the dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(london_airbnb_listings)</code></pre>

<p>We can then create a map with this dataset <code>london_airbnb_listings</code>.</p>

The above code-fragment is the same as in the previous section. However, instead of having a single lng/lat value for one location, we used the <code>longitude</code> and <code>latitude</code> columns in <code>london_airbnb_listings</code>. Note that <em>~</em> symbol was used to distinguish the column names from the variables (without <em>~</em>, <code>longitude</code> and <code>latitude</code> are user-defined variables, as in previous section).</p>
<p>We can notice that the above code-fragment will take a while to render the map, due to a large number of locations (1000 - note that we only select the first 1000 instead of all 25K locations). To solve this problem, clustering methods have been used to group locations within a neighbourhood into one marker. There are many clustering methods, the one used by Leaflet is <em>plain greedy clustering</em> (more <a href="http://leafletjs.com/2012/08/20/guest-post-markerclusterer-0-1-released.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>To use this clustering method, we can re-run the code as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>clusteredMap &lt;- leaflet(data = london_airbnb_listings)
clusteredMap &lt;- addTiles(clusteredMap)
clusteredMap &lt;- addMarkers(clusteredMap,~longitude,~latitude,clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),popup = ~name)
clusteredMap</code></pre>

<div id="lines-and-shapes" class="section level2">
<h2>Lines and Shapes</h2>
<p>So far we have been using points data only. Sometime it would be easier/better to visualise data using lines and shapes. For example, you might want to draw a line between an airbnb home to your favourite place of interest (POI) to estimate the distance, or draw a circle for each airbnb home to show how many reviews they have received.</p>
<p>In this section, we will draw lines between 100 points from our dataset to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ben">Big Ben</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will create a random sample of 100 points from <code>london_airbnb_listings</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>airbnb_home_sample100 &lt;- london_airbnb_listings[sample(1:nrow(london_airbnb_listings), 100),]</code></pre>
<p>Now we will try to draw a line from a point to another.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m &lt;- leaflet()
m &lt;- addTiles(m)
# add a marker at UoLiv
m &lt;- addMarkers(m,lng = -2.9655722,lat =  53.405936)
# add a marker at Big Ben
m &lt;- addMarkers(m,lng = -0.124661,lat =  51.500756)
# create a line between 2 points
m &lt;- addPolylines(m,lng = c(-2.9655722,-0.124661),lat = c( 53.405936, 51.500756))
m</code></pre>

<p>Next, we will create a Leaflet map with data from the random sample, add markers for these 100 points and draw a line from each of these points to Big Ben. We will need to use a loop to draw all 100 lines.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m &lt;- leaflet(data = airbnb_home_sample100)

<h2>Your Turn!</h2>
<p>Now you have been shown how to create Leaflet maps with open data. In this section, we have some small exercise for you to try what we have learnt so far (and what we haven’t covered so far). You can choose any of the below exercises (or all).</p>
<div id="bubble-map-difficulty-level" class="section level3">
<h3>Bubble Map [Difficulty Level: +]</h3>
<p>Create a bubble map to visual the number of review each airbnb home has. A bubble should have size in correspondence to the number of reviews. Places without any review can be ignored/filtered out in advanced. You can take a random sample of size 1000 from our London airbnb dataset.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hints:</strong> use <code> addCircle()</code> function *</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="classifying-accommodation-by-room-type-difficulty-level" class="section level3">
<h3>Classifying Accommodation by Room Type [Difficulty Level: ++]</h3>
<p>An <em>airbnb.com</em> accommodation has at least one of the following room type: “Entire home/apt”, “Private room”, and “Shared room”. Create a map to visual a random sample of 1000 airbnb places and show the room type classification on the map. How you might visualise this information is up to you (data scientists always need their imagination :)).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hints:</strong> <code>addCirles</code>, <code>addMarkers</code>, colors, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="price-and-location-difficulty-level" class="section level3">
<h3>Price and Location [Difficulty Level: +++]</h3>
<p>There are some open datasets about train station usages, such as ones from <a href="http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/published-stats/station-usage-estimates">Office of Rail and Road</a>. Busy train stations with non-season tickets might locate near tourist hotspots. However, it is unclear how prices/counts of airbnb listings reflects how busy the train stations are within the same neighbourhood. As a data scientist, your task is to show this refection (if exists) on a Leaftlet map.</p>
<p>The original data set with column description is available at <a href="http://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/excel_doc/0019/20179/Estimates-of-Station-Usage-in-2014-15.xlsx">here</a>. A cleaner version for London stations only has been made ready for you <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/f1ed6vv6l3ssvem/london_trainstation_1415est.csv">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hints:</strong> note that we are only interested in non-season tickets. A basic visualisation can show bubbles with sizes and color correponding to the prices and the stations’ entries/exits, respectively.</li>

<h1>Short Courses & Continuing Professional Development</h1>

A number of short courses are run by the university covering GIS and use of spatial data.


<h2><a href = "https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-qgis-spatial-data">Introduction to QGIS: Understanding and Presenting Spatial Data</a></h2>

<p>This course introduces spatial data and shows you how to import and display spatial data within the open source GIS program QGIS. We cover creating choropleth maps, some basic spatial data analysis (e.g. calculating rates) and appropriate methods of visualising spatial data. By the end of the course you will be able to load data into QGIS, symbolise it effectively and be able to prepare a publication quality map. 

<p>The course is developed as a one day training course, and the material is freely available online under Creative Commons. If you wish to attend the training course, please keep an eye on our <a href="blog/">blog</a> or email <a href="mailto:n.bearman@liverpool.ac.uk">Nick Bearman</a> to be added to the mailing list to hear about future courses. 

<h2><a href = "https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis">Introduction to Using R as a GIS</a></h2>

<p>This course is an introduction to R, how to load and manage spatial data and how to create maps using R. We will look at appropriate ways of using classifications for choropleth maps, using loops in R to create multiple maps and some basic spatial analysis. We will be using RStudio to work with the R environment. By the end of the course you will be able to load data into R, represent it effectively and be able to prepare an output quality map.

<h1>Modules</h1>

<h2><a href = "/training/WebMapping/">Web Mapping and Analysis (ENVS456)</a></h2>

<p>The module has two main aims. First, it seeks to to provide hands-on experience and training in the design and generation of web-based mapping and geographical information tools. Second, it seeks to provide hands-on experience and training in the use of software to access, analyse and visualize web-based geographical information.</p>

<h2><a href = "http://darribas.org/gds15/">Geographic Data Science (ENVS363/563)</a></h2>

The module provides students with core competences in Geographic Data Science (GDS). This
includes the following:
<ul>
<li>Advancing their statistical and numerical literacy.</li>

<li>Introducing basic principles of programming and state-of-the-art computational tools for
GDS.</li>

<li>Presenting a comprehensive overview of the main methodologies available to the Geographic
Data Scientist, as well as their intuition as to how and when they can be applied.</li>

<li>Focusing on real world applications of these techniques in a geographical and applied
context.</li>
</ul>

## Alex Singleton <div class="avatar-frame"><img src="/public/images/alexsingleton.jpg"></img></div>
_Professor of Geographic Information Science_  

Alex is a Professor of Geographic Information Science.  He was appointed to the university as a Lecturer in 2010, promoted to Reader in 2014 and previously held research positions at University College London from 2003. He holds a PhD from UCL and a BSc (1st class Hons) in Geography from the University of Manchester. Alex's research concerns how social and spatial complexities of individual behaviour can be represented and understood within a framework of quantitative social science and computer modelling. In particular, his research has extended a geographic tradition of area classification, developing a broad critique of the ways in which geodemographic methods can be refined through modern scientific approaches to data mining, geographic information science and quantitative human geography.

## Dani Arribas-Bel <div class="avatar-frame"><img src="/public/images/darribas.jpg"></img></div>
_Lecturer in Geographic Data Science_  

Dani joined the Geographic Data Science Lab in October 2015. Previously, he
held positions as Lecturer in Human Geography at the University of Birmingham, postdoctoral
researcher at the Department of Spatial Economics at the VU University
(Amsterdam), and postdoctoral researcher at the GeoDa Center for Geospatial
Analysis and Computation at Arizona State University. Trained as an economist,
Dani is interested in the spatial structure of cities as well as in the
quantitative and computational methods required to leverage the power of the
large amount of urban data increasingly becoming available. He is also part of
the team of core developers of [PySAL](http://pysal.org), the open-source library written in
Python for spatial analysis.

## Les Dolgea <div class="avatar-frame"><img src="/public/images/lesdolega.jpg"></img></div>

_Data Scientist_

Les is interested in economic/retail geography and GIS. More specifically, his expertise is in resilience of economic systems, in particular the performance of town centres and their evolutionary trajectories. His background is in environmental science and retail geography. He did his MSc in GIS and Environmental Management at Brighton University and during his PhD at Southampton University between 2009 and 20012 he investigated the impact of the 2008-09 economic crisis on UK high streets. Then he was involved in the project delivering evidence review on UK town centres performance commissioned by the DCLG. Leszek, currently is working on e-Resilience project which aims to deliver a nationwide classification of e-Resilience at LSOA level and develop methodology for estimation of nationwide retail catchment areas taking into account town centre structure, attractiveness and position in the retail hierarchy.
